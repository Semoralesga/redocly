title: 'JSON:API Resource Identifier Object'
description: >
  A JSON:API-compliant resource identifier object. An inheritable object schema
  that contains the basic framework of a Resource Identifier Object from the
  JSON:API spec.


  A “resource identifier object” is an object that identifies an individual
  resource.


  A “resource identifier object” MUST contain `type` and `id` members.


  A “resource identifier object” MAY also include a `meta` member, whose value
  is a meta object that contains non-standard meta-information. If necessary,
  the `meta` property should be added by the inheriting schema.
