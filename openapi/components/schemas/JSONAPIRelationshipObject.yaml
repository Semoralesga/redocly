title: 'JSON:API Relationship Object'
description: >
  This schema can be used when defining `relationships` objects within a
  JSON:API resource object.


  The value of the relationships key MUST be an object (a “relationships
  object”). Members of the relationships object (“relationships”) represent
  references from the resource object in which it’s defined to other resource
  objects.


  Relationships may be to-one or to-many.

      Resource linkage in a compound document allows a client to link together
      all of the included resource objects without having to GET any URLs via
      links.


      Resource linkage MUST be represented as one of the following:

      * null for empty to-one relationships.

      * an empty array ([]) for empty to-many relationships.

      * a single resource identifier object for non-empty to-one relationships.

      * an array of resource identifier objects for non-empty to-many
      relationships.
