title: 'JSON:API type Member'
description: >
  The `type` member is used to describe resource objects that share common
  attributes and relationships.


  Note: The type member is required in every resource object throughout requests
  and responses in JSON:API. There are some cases, such as when POSTing to an
  endpoint representing heterogeneous data, when the type could not be inferred
  from the endpoint. However, picking and choosing when it is required would be
  confusing; it would be hard to remember when it was required and when it was
  not. Therefore, to improve consistency and minimize confusion, type is always
  required.
